    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>SportsBook67 is an independent affiliate website dedicated to helping bettors navigate the rapidly expanding world of legal U.S. sports betting. We specialize in finding and comparing the best sportsbook bonuses available in December 2025 across major states including New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Illinois, Colorado, Arizona, Virginia, North Carolina, Indiana, Tennessee, Maryland, Massachusetts, and West Virginia.</p>
    
    <p>Our mission is simple: cut through the marketing noise and provide you with clear, unbiased information about current promotional offers, welcome bonuses, and exclusive deals from licensed operators. Whether you're a seasoned bettor or new to sports betting, we're here to help you maximize the value of every signup and deposit.</p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>At SportsBook67, we believe that finding the right sportsbook bonus shouldn't require hours of research or deciphering confusing terms and conditions. Our team is committed to:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Unbiased Reviews:</strong> We provide honest, detailed assessments of sportsbook bonuses, user experiences, and platform features. Our reviews are based on real testing and user feedback, not just promotional materials.</li>
      <li><strong>Up-to-Date Comparisons:</strong> The sports betting landscape changes constantly. We monitor bonus offers daily to ensure our comparisons reflect current December 2025 promotions, not outdated information from months ago.</li>
      <li><strong>Expert Insights:</strong> Our team understands the nuances of bonus terms, rollover requirements, and promotional structures. We break down complex offers into clear, actionable information that helps you make informed decisions.</li>
      <li><strong>Value Maximization:</strong> Beyond just listing bonuses, we help you understand which offers provide the best long-term value based on your betting style, preferred sports, and state-specific availability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Exclusive Rewards Program</h2>
    <p>What sets SportsBook67 apart is our unique community rewards program that puts real value back into your pocket. Here's how it works:</p>
    
    <p><strong>Instant Signup Bonus:</strong> When you join SportsBook67 for free, you immediately receive 5,000 points in your account. No deposit required, no strings attached. These points are yours to keep and can be redeemed for Amazon gift cards.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Referral Rewards:</strong> Share your personal referral link with friends who are interested in sports betting. When a friend signs up through your link and makes their first deposit at any sportsbook, you both earn 10,000 points – equivalent to a $10 Amazon gift card. This creates a win-win scenario where you're rewarded for helping others discover great betting opportunities.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Responsible Betting Focus:</strong> Our rewards program is designed to enhance your betting experience while promoting responsible gambling practices. We believe that betting should be fun, entertaining, and never put your financial security at risk. The Amazon gift card rewards provide tangible value that complements your sportsbook bonuses, making every signup more rewarding.</p>

    <h2>How We Make Money</h2>
    <p>Transparency is a core value at SportsBook67. We want you to understand exactly how our business model works:</p>
    
    <p><strong>Affiliate Commissions:</strong> When you click on one of our links and sign up for a sportsbook, we may earn a commission from that operator. This is a standard practice in the affiliate marketing industry and is how we're able to provide free reviews, comparisons, and bonus information.</p>
    
    <p><strong>No Extra Cost to You:</strong> Importantly, these commissions come directly from the sportsbook operators – they don't increase the cost of bonuses or change the terms of any promotional offers. You receive the exact same bonus whether you sign up through our link or directly through the sportsbook's website.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Keeping Reviews Free:</strong> These affiliate relationships allow us to maintain our website, conduct thorough research, and continuously update our bonus comparisons without charging you subscription fees or requiring paid memberships. Our goal is to provide value that earns your trust, not to push you toward any particular sportsbook.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Editorial Independence:</strong> While we earn commissions, our editorial content remains independent. We don't accept payments to feature specific sportsbooks or to write positive reviews. Our rankings and recommendations are based on objective criteria including bonus value, user experience, platform quality, and customer service.</p>

    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>SportsBook67 was founded by a team of passionate sports fans who experienced firsthand the frustration of navigating confusing bonus offers and promotional terms. In the early days of legalized sports betting, we found ourselves spending hours comparing different welcome bonuses, trying to understand rollover requirements, and figuring out which offers were actually worth pursuing.</p>
    
    <p>We realized that many bettors were missing out on valuable bonuses simply because the information wasn't presented clearly. Some were signing up for offers that sounded great but had restrictive terms. Others were overlooking better deals because they didn't know where to look.</p>
    
    <p>This frustration led us to create SportsBook67 – a platform that cuts through the confusion with clear comparisons, honest reviews, and expert insights. We've built relationships with major sportsbook operators to ensure we have access to the latest promotional information, and we've developed a rewards program that gives back to our community.</p>
    
    <p>Today, SportsBook67 serves thousands of bettors across the United States, helping them find the best bonuses in their state and earn Amazon gift cards along the way. We're constantly evolving our platform based on user feedback, adding new features, and expanding our coverage to include more states and operators as legal sports betting continues to grow.</p>

    <h2>Rewards Program Rules</h2>
    <p>SportsBook67 operates a community rewards program that allows eligible users to earn points redeemable for Amazon gift cards. Participation in the rewards program is subject to the following rules and conditions:</p>
    
    <h3>Signup Bonus</h3>
    <p>When you create a free account on SportsBook67.com, you will receive 5,000 points as a welcome bonus. This signup bonus is awarded automatically upon successful account creation and email verification. No deposit or purchase is required to receive the signup bonus.</p>
    
    <h3>Referral Rewards</h3>
    <p>You can earn additional points by referring friends to SportsBook67. When a friend signs up through your personal referral link and makes their first deposit at any sportsbook, both you and your referred friend will earn 10,000 points each. These 10,000 points are equivalent to a $10 Amazon gift card redemption.</p>
    
    <p>To qualify for referral rewards:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your friend must sign up using your unique referral link provided in your account dashboard</li>
      <li>Your friend must complete their first deposit at a sportsbook after signing up through your link</li>
      <li>Both accounts must be in good standing and comply with these Terms of Service</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Point Redemption</h3>
    <p>Points can be redeemed for Amazon gift cards through your account dashboard. The current redemption rate is 10,000 points = $10 Amazon gift card. Gift cards are fulfilled via email to the email address associated with your account. Processing time for gift card redemptions is typically 5-7 business days, though we strive to process redemptions as quickly as possible.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Amazon gift cards are provided as a reward for participation in our program. There is no cash alternative available, and gift cards cannot be exchanged for cash, transferred to other accounts, or refunded once issued.</p>
    
    <h3>Point Expiration and Non-Transferability</h3>
    <p>Points are non-transferable and may not be sold, traded, or transferred to another account. Points will expire after 12 months of account inactivity. Account inactivity is defined as no points earned, redeemed, or account login activity for a continuous 12-month period.</p>
    
    <p>We will make reasonable efforts to notify you via email before your points expire due to inactivity. However, it is your responsibility to monitor your account and use your points before they expire.</p>
    
    <h3>Program Modifications and Cancellation</h3>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or cancel the rewards program, or any aspect of it, at any time with or without notice. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Changing point values, redemption rates, or reward structures</li>
      <li>Modifying eligibility requirements for earning or redeeming points</li>
      <li>Adding or removing reward options</li>
      <li>Suspending the program temporarily or permanently</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>If we make material changes to the rewards program, we will attempt to notify users via email or through a notice on our website. However, we are not obligated to provide advance notice for all program changes.</p>
    
    <h3>Abuse and Fraud Prevention</h3>
    <p>We reserve the right to revoke points, suspend accounts, or terminate participation in the rewards program for any user who engages in fraudulent activity, abuse, or violation of these Terms. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Creating multiple accounts to earn multiple signup bonuses</li>
      <li>Using fake or fraudulent referral links or accounts</li>
      <li>Attempting to manipulate the referral system through bots, scripts, or automated means</li>
      <li>Providing false information during account creation</li>
      <li>Violating any applicable laws or regulations</li>
      <li>Engaging in any activity that we determine, in our sole discretion, to be abusive or fraudulent</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>If we determine that you have engaged in fraudulent activity or abuse, we may immediately revoke all points, suspend or terminate your account, and prohibit you from participating in the rewards program in the future. We are not obligated to provide a refund or compensation for revoked points.</p>
